    <title>Triton School Budget 2024/25 - No More Cuts</title>

        <h1>Triton School Budget - No More Cuts</h1>
        <p>Dear Newbury, Byfield, and Plum Island friends and neighbors. The Newbury Select Board is pushing to cut the Triton School Budget by $250-500k for the 2024-25 school year.  These cuts are on top of an additional $900k of cuts that were included by the district in an attempt to appease the Select Boards of Newbury and Rowley so they would pass the proposed budget.  These cuts are being proposed as “level services” but they will have an immediate impact on our school community.  The proposed cuts are eliminating our elementary district STEM and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) teachers as well as an administrative position in the Triton offices.<br><br>
		It is true that Newbury’s overall contribution will increase at a higher rate (compared to Rowley and Salisbury) this year due to the state formula for minimum contributions.  Our property values have increased dramatically in recent years and as such the minimum amount has increased relative to the other towns.<br><br>
		The proposed cuts are unnecessary and damaging to our schools and community.  We are already struggling to meet the needs of our students in many ways and further reductions will do nothing but make this job more difficult.  
		<br><br>
		If you are a Newbury resident and Triton Schools supporter, please email the members of our select board to voice your opinion. Please note that an override vote may be necessary to pay for the increase in the school budget. However, any increase in individual tax rates will likely be only a very small amount on average.  Public education is a shared responsibility!<br><br>

				  &body=Dear Ms. Greco%0D%0AI am a resident of Newbury and a supporter of our public schools. I would like to ask you to please support the proposed Triton School budget without ANY further cuts. The proposed cuts are unnecessary and will be detrimental to the Triton schools and community. I recognize and will accept that this may cause an increase in our property taxes.
          %0D%0A%0D%0AThank you,%0D%0A
